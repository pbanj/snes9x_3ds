# Snes9x for 3DS — Stereoscopic 3D Fork

This is a fork of [matbo87/snes9x_3ds](https://github.com/matbo87/snes9x_3ds) that adds **real stereoscopic 3D** to SNES games on the Nintendo 3DS. Background layers are separated at different depths using the 3DS parallax barrier display, similar to how SEGA's M2 studio handled their [3D Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Classics) series.

Slide the 3D slider up and SNES backgrounds gain real depth — sprites stay at the screen plane.

## How to use

1. Download `matbo87-snes9x_3ds.3dsx` from the [latest release](https://github.com/f4mrfaux/snes9x_3ds/releases)
2. Copy to `sd:/3ds/snes9x_3ds/snes9x.3dsx` on your 3DS SD card
3. Launch from Homebrew Launcher
4. Load a game and slide the 3D slider up

With the slider at 0, the emulator behaves identically to upstream — zero overhead.

## What's different from upstream?

[matbo87/snes9x_3ds](https://github.com/matbo87/snes9x_3ds) is an excellent SNES emulator with themes, thumbnails, bezels, cheats, and a citro3D GPU rendering pipeline. This fork preserves all of that and adds a stereoscopic 3D rendering layer on top.

| | matbo87 (upstream) | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| SNES emulation | Full | Full (identical) |
| Themes, thumbnails, bezels, cheats | Yes | Yes |
| Stereoscopic 3D | No | Yes — M2 3D Classics style (BG, OBJ, Mode 7) |
| 3D slider control | No | Yes — physical slider controls depth intensity |
| Per-layer depth tuning | No | Yes — per-game BG0-BG3, OBJ, Mode 7, Backdrop scale gauges |
| Stretch mode compensation | No | Yes — parallax adjusts across all aspect ratios |
| ROM Info dialog | No | Yes — in-menu ROM details |
| Runtime debug logging | No | Yes — toggle in settings, no rebuild needed |
| Slider at 0 | N/A | Identical to upstream (mono fast path) |

## How it works: Shader-Uniform Replay

The SNES renders graphics in layers — up to four background planes (BG0-BG3), a sprite layer (OBJ), and a backdrop color. Normally these are composited flat onto a single 2D framebuffer. This fork renders each main-screen layer **twice** (once per eye) with a small horizontal offset to create parallax.

The critical design choice is that this is done **entirely on the GPU**:

1. **CPU builds tile vertices once** — no extra CPU work compared to mono rendering
2. **GPU draws main-screen layers twice** with different `stereoOffset` geometry shader uniforms — one pass for the left eye, one for the right
3. Each eye's result goes to a separate 256x256 texture (`SNES_MAIN` for left, `SNES_MAIN_R` for right)
4. The textures are composited to the 3DS top screen's left and right framebuffers via the parallax barrier

Window/clip regions and sub-screen transparency layers are drawn only once (they don't need stereo separation).

### Depth assignment

Layer depths are derived from the emulator's own compositing priority values — the `depth0`/`depth1` parameters already used by the `DRAW_*` macros in `gfxhw.cpp`. These encode which layers are in front of or behind others, so we reuse them directly as parallax depth factors. No per-game profiles are needed.

For **Mode 1** (the most common SNES mode — Super Mario World, Zelda, Mega Man X, etc.):

| Layer | Stereo Effect |
|-------|---------------|
| BG0 (foreground tiles) | Pops toward the viewer |
| BG1 (mid-ground scenery) | Pops slightly toward the viewer |
| BG2 (far background) | Recedes into the screen |
| Sprites (OBJ) | Per-priority depth — OBJ.0 recedes behind BGs, OBJ.3 pops forward |
| Backdrop | Deepest — behind everything |

Depth values change automatically per SNES graphics mode (Modes 0-6). Mode 7 games (F-Zero, Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Kart, Pilotwings) use **perspective-based stereo** — the geometry shader scales depth by each scanline's Y position, creating a natural vanishing-point effect where the horizon is flat and the foreground has full parallax.

### Per-game depth settings

The options menu includes a **Stereoscopic 3D** section with per-layer scale gauges:

- **BG0-BG3 Scale** — Control how much each background layer pops forward or recedes (0% = flat at screen plane, 100% = default, 200% = exaggerated)
- **OBJ Scale** — Sprite layer depth (per-priority: OBJ.0 behind BGs, OBJ.3 in front)
- **Mode 7 Scale** — Perspective depth for Mode 7 games (F-Zero, Yoshi's Island, etc.)
- **Backdrop Scale** — Solid color background depth
- **Reset 3D to Defaults** — Resets all scales to 100%
- **Apply 3D settings to all games** — Toggle between global and per-game depth profiles

The physical 3D slider on the side of the 3DS controls overall depth intensity. The per-layer scales let you fine-tune which layers are more or less pronounced on a per-game basis.

### Stretch mode compensation

Stereo parallax is automatically compensated across all display stretch modes (native 256px, 320px, full 400px, Fit 8:7). The offset is normalized by `256/stretchWidth` so perceived depth stays consistent regardless of aspect ratio. The Fit 8:7 edge case (runtime `sWidth` override to 256 when `PPU.ScreenHeight >= 239`) is handled explicitly.

### Key technical details

- **Geometry shader uniform**: `stereoOffset` at register #5 in `shader_tiles.g.pica`, applied to projected X coordinates after the projection matrix multiply
- **Clip-space scaling**: The offset is converted from pixel units to clip space (`* 2.0f / 256.0f`) since the orthographic projection maps 0..256 to -1..+1
- **Right-eye texture redirect**: `SNES_MAIN_R` is a texture ID only, not a member of the `SGPU_TARGET_ID` enum (adding it would overflow the 3-bit `BW_TARGET` bitfield in the packed render state union). The redirect happens in `gpu3dsApplyRenderState()` when `GPU3DS.stereoRightEye` is set
- **Depth buffer isolation**: The shared `SNES_DEPTH` buffer is cleared and window_lr clip regions are re-rendered between eye passes, preventing left-eye depth values from contaminating right-eye depth testing
- **IOD range**: 0-3 pixels maximum displacement per layer, controlled linearly by the 3D slider position
- **PICA200 ALU limitation**: The geometry shader cannot reference uniforms as direct operands in `add` — the uniform value is `mov`'d to a temp register first

### Bugfixes (non-stereo)

Fixes found during development that improve robustness independent of the stereo feature:

- **Memory leak in `isReal3DS()`** — Heap-allocated version strings were never freed; switched to stack allocation
- **Null pointer dereference in sound init** — `leftBuffer`/`rightBuffer` were derived from `fullBuffers` before the null check
- **Missing return values** — `S9xReadMousePosition` and `S9xReadSuperScopePosition` stubs had no return statement

## FAQ

### Does this affect performance?

Minimally. The CPU builds vertices once regardless of stereo mode. The GPU draws main-screen layers a second time, but the PICA200 handles 256x240 tile rendering comfortably. Target is 50-60 FPS with stereo enabled.

### Can I adjust depth per game?

Yes. Open the menu during gameplay and scroll to the **Stereoscopic 3D** section. Each background layer has its own scale gauge (0-200%). Settings are saved per game by default, or you can check "Apply 3D settings to all games" to use a single global profile. The physical 3D slider still controls overall intensity.

### Does this work with all SNES games?

It works with all games that use standard tile-based BG modes (Modes 0-6), which covers the vast majority of the SNES library. Mode 7 games (F-Zero, Yoshi's Island, Pilotwings) get perspective-based stereo depth with a dedicated Mode 7 Scale control.

### Can I turn it off?

Yes. Slide the 3D slider to 0. The emulator runs an identical mono code path with zero overhead — the eye loop executes once and no stereo uniforms are written.

### What about the CIA version?

Both `.3dsx` (Homebrew Launcher) and `.cia` (installable title) versions are provided in each release.
